# Cooka
## Description
Cooka is a website that allows a user to enter any number of available ingredients and search for recipes that can be made using those ingredients. The website will display recipes in descending order from recipes with the highest number of matching ingredients to recipes with the lowest number of matching ingredients. The front-end of this project will be handled by Cameron Vallin and Teresa Vu, while the back-end will be handled by Michelle Vu and Sammy Clark.
