# Groupify
## Description
Groupify is a Spotify extension that allows users to create a shared queue to which anyone can add songs. Spotify has a feature that is similar to this one; however, it is limited in its uses and has flaws that could be imporved on. Groupify caters to these shortcomings while expanding the idea with other features. These features include song upvoting, group minigames, and song approval. The front-end of this project will be handled by Cameron Vallin and Teresa Vu, while the back-end will be handled by Michelle Vu and Sammy Clark.

##Ideas: 
       Democratic song upvoting or Queue leader(Leader must approve queued songs) 
       Mini-Games: Guessing who queued a song, voting for worst song
