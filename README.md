# Groupify
By: Sammy Clark, Cameron Vallin, Michelle Vu, Teresa Vu
## Description
Groupify is a Spotify extension that allows users to create a shared queue to which anyone can add songs. Spotify has a feature that is similar to this one; however, it is limited in its uses and has flaws that could be improved on. Groupify caters to these shortcomings while expanding the idea with other features. These features include song upvoting, group minigames, and song approval. 

The group minigame will begin with a catergory being randomly generated. Then, each member of the group can add a song to the queue that fits within the chosen category. The queue will then play each song anonymously. By the end of the queue, members will vote on which song to eliminate, thereby eliminating the corresponding player, and reveal who queued each song. The next round will randomly generate a new category and the rounds will continue until there is one person left. 

The front-end of this project will be handled by Cameron Vallin and Teresa Vu, while the back-end will be handled by Michelle Vu and Sammy Clark.  

## Ideas: 
       Democratic song upvoting or Queue leader(Leader must approve queued songs) 
       Mini-Games: Guessing who queued a song, voting for worst song
